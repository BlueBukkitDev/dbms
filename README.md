# dbms

DBMS is designed to be a basic CLI to interact with an upcoming database framework wherein tables and strong references are abandoned in favor of tags and indirect relations. Such a database is useful for massive data management and sorting, allowing for storage optimization by reducing empty columns and instead only inputting relevant data. The name will probably be updated in the future to more accurately reflect what it is, and to be less generic. 
The database is structured and designed in such a way that querying through data does not require the loading of said data. This is infinitely scalable, allowing for extreme precision or extreme speed, with a balance being comfortable at both. The CLI will be required in order to properly interface with the database, and in the future, front-end programs or server OS systems may directly implement the CLI in order to facilitate a more user-friendly or graphically visible experience. Any data can be stored, in the form of any file; text or numerical data can also be stored directly on an entry. For large data or separate files, the address pointer will be stored in the entry instead of the data, allowing for blazing-fast data searching and query responses, with only the final file load taking a normal amount of time to execute.
